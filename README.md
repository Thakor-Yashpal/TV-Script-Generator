# 📺 TV Script Generator  

Harnessing **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to generate creative television scripts from the **How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM)** dialog dataset.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The **TV Script Generator** uses deep learning techniques to model and generate natural-sounding TV show scripts. By training on the **How I Met Your Mother** dialog dataset, the RNN learns language patterns, character interactions, and comedic timing, enabling it to produce original lines of dialog in the style of the show.  

This project demonstrates:  
- Preprocessing real-world sitcom scripts.  
- Building and training RNNs with embedding layers and LSTMs/GRUs.  
- Generating new, character-driven dialog that mimics HIMYM’s humor and tone.

## 📂 Project Structure  
# TV-Script-Generator


Ted: You know, sometimes life is just... weird.  
Barney: Please, Ted, weird is my middle name.  
Robin: Really? I thought it was "wait-for-it."  
Marshall: No, that’s his actual middle name.  



## 📈 Results ##

The model learns the comedic and conversational style of How I Met Your Mother.

Generates character-driven scripts that feel like new HIMYM scenes.

Quality improves with more training and larger hidden layers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used ##

Python 3.x

PyTorch (or TensorFlow if you used it)

NumPy, Pandas for preprocessing

Jupyter Notebook for experiments

## 📌 Future Improvements ##

Experiment with Transformer-based architectures.

Fine-tune on other sitcoms for cross-style comparisons (Friends, The Office).

Deploy as a web app for interactive script generation.
